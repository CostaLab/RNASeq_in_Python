In this course, we will perform gene expression analysis with data from CD34+ cells from MPN patients presented in the above study ([paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00277-021-04615-8)). For this, we will consider previously normalized gene expression data and will perform down-stream analysis such as principal component analysis, clustering, identification of differentially expressed genes and gene ontology analysis.
